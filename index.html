    <p>hi, i'm an associate professor of philosophy at mcgill university. before coming to mcgill, i was a research assistant professor in philosophy at unc-chapel hill and core faculty in the unc/duke program in philosophy, politics, and economics. i completed my phd at the university of arizona in 2017. i was also a visiting fellow at harvard in 2017 and an rsss visiting fellow at the australian national university in 2019.</p>
    
    <p>most of my work to date is in ethical theory, but i'm currently interested in, and writing about, ethical and political issues to do with digital technologies. at the moment, i'm thinking most about the structure and governance of digital spaces, and how the decentralization of important technologies (social & ai) can cure much of what ails our digital society.</p>
    
    <p>i'm also the director of mcgill's philosophy, policy, and technology lab.</p>
    
    <p>i also organize the annual chapel hill normativity workship with alex worsnip.</p>
