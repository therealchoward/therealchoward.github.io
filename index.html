    <p>hi, i'm an associate professor of philosophy at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/philosophy/">mcgill university</a>. before coming to mcgill, i was a research assistant professor in philosophy at <a href="https://philosophy.unc.edu/">unc-chapel hill</a> and core faculty in the <a href="https://ppe.unc.edu/">unc/duke program in philosophy, politics, and economics</a>. i completed my phd at the <a href="https://philosophy.arizona.edu/">university of arizona</a> in 2017.</p> 
    
    <p>most of my work to date is in ethical theory, but i'm now interested in, and writing about, ethical & political issues to do with digital technologies. at the moment, i'm thinking about the structure & governance of digital spaces, and how the decentralization of important technologies (social & ai) can capture the benefits of those technologies while avoiding (some of) their attendant costs.</p>
    
    <p>in my free time, i direct mcgill's philosophy, policy, and technology lab (site under construction) & organize the annual <a href="https://normativity.web.unc.edu/">chapel hill normativity workshop</a> with <a href="https://www.alexworsnip.com/">alex worsnip</a> & <a href="https://margaretshea.com/">maggie shea</a>.</p>
