    <p>hi, i'm an associate professor of philosophy at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/philosophy/">mcgill university</a>. before coming to mcgill, i was a research assistant professor in philosophy at <a href="https://philosophy.unc.edu/">unc-chapel hill</a> and core faculty in the <a href="https://ppe.unc.edu/">unc/duke program in philosophy, politics, and economics</a>. i completed my phd at the <a href="https://philosophy.arizona.edu/">university of arizona</a> in 2017.</p> 
    
    <p>i was a visiting fellow at <a href="https://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/">harvard</a> in 2017 & an rsss visiting fellow at the <a href="https://philosophy.cass.anu.edu.au/">australian national university</a> in 2019.</p>
    
    <p>most of my work to date is in ethical theory, but i'm currently interested in, and writing about, ethical and political issues to do with digital technologies. at the moment, i'm thinking most about the structure and governance of digital spaces, and how the decentralization of important technologies (social & ai) can capture the benefits of those technologies while avoiding (some of) their attendant costs.</p>
    
    <p>i'm also the director of mcgill's philosophy, policy, and technology lab (site under construction).</p>
    
    <p>i also organize the annual <a href="https://normativity.web.unc.edu/">chapel hill normativity workshop</a> with <a href="https://www.alexworsnip.com/">alex worsnip</a> and <a href="https://margaretshea.com/">maggie shea</a>.</p>
    
    <p>i'm also currently a strategy consultant at <a href="https://doodles.app">doodles</a>.</p>
